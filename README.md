# Staying Healthy
- A community project from Professional Skills for Engineers - HCMUT
- Developing by Team 06 - Class 03
# General Information:
- We attempts to design and implement a website that is able to:
  - Provide cooking recipes base on users input of desired calories and ingredients. 
  - List of 20+ recipes with detail information of how much energy it will supply, which are ready for users to pick.
- All the instructions are crystall clear and be kept as short as possible.
- The recipes are constructed rely on 2 main criteria:
  - Limit the usage of cooking oil and spices such as: MSG, salt, fish sauce...
  - Applying 2 main methods which are boil and steam.
  - By following these 2 standards, it is feasible that we can maintain the freshness, original flavour and also nutritions of all ingredients.
