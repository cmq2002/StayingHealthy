# Staying Healthy
- A community project from HCMUT Professional Skills for Engineers Course
- Developing by Team 06 - Class 03
# General Information:
- We attempt to design and implement a website that is able to:
  - Generate cooking recipes based on the user's calorie and ingredient preferences.
  - A list of 20+ recipes with detailed information on how much energy they will provide, ready for users to choose from.
- All the instructions must be crystal clear and kept as short as possible.
- The recipes are built around two main criteria:
  - Reduce your use of cooking oil and spices like MSG, broth mix, salt, fish sauce,.etc
  - Using two main methods: boiling and steaming.
- By following these 2 standards, it is feasible to maintain the freshness, original flavor, and nutrition of all ingredients.
